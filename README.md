# SpotifyFullStack
Full Stack project sourcing data from Spotify

## Installations Required
*	Install Homebrew
*	Install Pyenv (Good way to manage diff python versions). Use python version 3 and above
*	pip install requests-cache

## Setup Last.FM
* Create Last.Fm account https://secure.last.fm/login
* Go to: Settings -> Applications -> Connect for both Spotify scrobbling/playback
* Create API account https://www.last.fm/api/account/create. Just full in Application name, Application description, leave last 2 blank.
* Store Credentials

## Setup login creds file (required)
Create a json file "loginCreds.json" and enter in the following information
```
[
    {
        "credsName": "(any name you want)",
        "inFile" : "(input file name).json",
        "outFile" : "(output file name).json",
        "username" : "(lastfm username)",
        "API_KEY" : "(lastfm api key)"
    } (insert comma, followed by more users you would like to have)
]
```
Once this is done, in the main function of lastfm.py, update the getUserCreds() function to your credsName

## Running file
* run lastfm.py -> this obtains recent tracks from lastfm.api, cleans/adds data and dumps a json file
* run analyzeData.py -> this goes through json output and creates metrics.
